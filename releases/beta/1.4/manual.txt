The program parameters works the next way:

encryption.out <input_path/image.pgm> <c/d> <password> <save_path/image.pgm(optional)>

	1º parameter: program name (encryption.out by default)

	2º parameter: <input_path/image.pgm>
		Input path of the file you want to encrypt or decrypt.

	3º parameter: <c/d>
		If c is selected the image would be encrypted, other ways, if d is selected,
		it would be decrypted.
		If other character is entered it would do anything.
	
	4º parameter: <password>
		the password which you want to encrypt, you are decrypting you must introduce 
		the same password with you encrypted the image.
		If left empty the program would do nothing.

	5º parameter: <save_path/image.pgm(optional)>
		Optional parameter, destiny path of the file, this parameter is optional,
		meaning that if left empty the save path would be the same as the input path.
		For security reasons is recommended to save the image overwriting itself 
		(input path = output path).
